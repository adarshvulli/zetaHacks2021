## ðŸ“‹ Description:
We developed a user-friendly employee payroll management system. Here we have mainly focused on the over-expectation and the user interface on how the final product would be. we significantly added separate features for the primary admin and an employee, where both of them have their specific features incorporated into their respective dashboards created specifically 

## ðŸ’»Tech Stack used:
- Frontend: HTML , CSS , JavaScript
- Backend : Python
- FrameWork : Django, Bootstrap
- Deployment : AWS

## âš™ Future scope of Development:
- Making the entire Site responsive on devices rather than a mobile device
- Adding more options for the primary master or the entire set of people who distributes the pay 
- Making the static employee dashboard dynamic 
- Making the visualization parts dynamic that would change with the new data added periodically 

## ðŸš€ Quick Start :

##### For Django:
**1. Create a Virtual Environment**

- *On macOS and Linux:*
  ```bash
    python3 -m venv env
  ```
- *Windows*
  ```bash
    py -m venv env
  ````

**2. Activate the Virtual Environment**
  - *On Windows*
    ```bash
    .\env\Scripts\activate
    ```
  - *On macOS and Linux:*
    ```bash
    source env/bin/activate
    ```

**3. Install dependencies using**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**4. Make Migrations**

```bash
  python manage.py makemigrations
  python manage.py migrate
```
**5. Run Server**

```bash
  python manage.py runserver
```

**5.** Go to ` http://127.0.0.1:8000/` and enjoy the application.
